## About Chord viewer

Sometimes I need to look for diatonic chords for a given key, there are some tools to do that, but I wanted to create one.

This will be the first version of a web app that will be able to return all diatonic chords for a specific key, maybe one day it will include sounds and tonal modes and more things.

But as a sort of MVP this version will display chords.

## Architecture

I found an interesting chord db written by tombatossals [chords-db](https://github.com/tombatossals/chords-db).

The first approach is to use this db to display chords.

Luckily for my plans, there is this package to display svg guitar chords using a the chords db, it is [react-chords](https://github.com/tombatossals/react-chords) by tombatossals (again).

## How does it work
The app fetches the chords db and turns it into an array.

Then it passes a filter to return the needed chords, based on an object.

Then renders the diagrams for those chords.

Lastly every chord will have an onClick listener to play the chord (stil working on that lol)

## About making noises
I'll try to use the midi data of the chords to produce some sound samples see: 
https://github.com/musicandcode/Chord-Player

https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal - Musical theory library

We have two main packages to use from tonaljs

* https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal/tree/main/packages/tonal: Returns notes data such as height, letter, midi, name, etc. e.g.

```  
note('C4');
```

* https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal/tree/main/packages/chord: Return chord data, such as notes, root, intervals, etc. e.g.

``` 
Chord.getChord("maj7", "G4", "B4"); // =>
// {
//   empty: false,
//   name: "G major seventh over B",
//   symbol: "Gmaj7/B",
//   tonic: "G4",
//   root: "B4",
//   rootDegree: 2,
//   setNum: 2193,
//   type: "major seventh",
//   aliases: ["maj7", "Î”", "ma7", "M7", "Maj7"],
//   chroma: "100010010001",
//   intervals: ["3M", "5P", "7M", "8P"],
//   normalized: "100010010001",
//   notes: ["B4", "D5", "F#5", "G5"],
//   quality: "Major",
// }
```

So we could use tonaljs instead of @tombatossals libraries but, the chords and notes data will not be created with a guitar in mind, I only want to see guitar chords, and I like the diagrams, so we will stick with that for now. However, I still want to hear noises when I click a chord diagram, howlerjs may have what we need. 

Or may not lol, howler can play locally stored sounds, wich means we need to record an store every chord sound needed and then map it to the handler, it looks doable, but not for today. (see # 10)

It is possible that we won't use the midi prop of the chord db, we may need to do some tweaks.
