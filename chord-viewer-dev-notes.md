# NOTES
## About Chord viewer

Sometimes I need to look for diatonic chords for a given key, there are some tools to do that, but I wanted to create one.

This will be the first version of a web app that will be able to return all diatonic chords for a specific key, maybe one day it will include sounds and tonal modes and more things.

But as a sort of MVP this version will display chords.

## Architecture

I found an interesting chord db written by tombatossals [chords-db](https://github.com/tombatossals/chords-db).

The first approach is to use this db to display chords.
